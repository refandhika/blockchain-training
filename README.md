# Blockchain Training

This is just my training repo for learning blockchain from scratch. This repo is following [freeCodeCamp 32-Hours Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ) with some adjustment to later version. Notable difference from the video and when i work on this are :

- Sepolia Testnet
- Solidity v0.8.24
- Ethers v6.12.1
- Hardhat v2.22.4

I'm using Javascript here not Typescript this might change in the future. I hope this will also help anyone want to learn blockchain.
